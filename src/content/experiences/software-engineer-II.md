### ARIS

My main work was focused on ARIS, a product of Software AG. ARIS is a BPM application that helps to turn your processes into value. By managing the entire process lifecycle with a single, integrated suite, ARIS enables you to define, analyze, simulate, optimize and control your processes.

### My Role
As a Software Engineer, my primary focus is on backend microservices that power critical parts of the ARIS platform, including User Management, Document Storage, Tenant Management, Elasticsearch, ZooKeeper, and Collaboration services. I also contribute to frontend tasks when required.

- ***My Contributions*** :
    - Designed and implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for the Document Storage service, enabling intelligent retrieval across thousands of documents used by large enterprise customers.
    - Enhanced document search capabilities, improving relevance, performance, and overall user experience.
    - Strengthened application security by improving the JWT token generation and validation algorithm and secret keys.
    - Enabled accurate identification of user origins across multiple identity providers such as SAML, SCIM, LDAP, and OAuth.
    - Worked extensively on core authentication and identity flows, resolving complex issues across SCIM, OAuth, and SAML integrations in enterprise environments.

- ***Highlights*** :
    - Represented the team on a one-week on-site business trip to Germany, collaborating closely with cross-functional stakeholders.
    - Contributed as a core member of one of the organization’s early Agentic AI teams, working on innovative, product focused AI solutions.
    - Built AI agents, reusable skills, and MCP servers as part of an innovation project to accelerate internal feature development using Claude Code, while adhering to enterprise processes, test coverage standards, and quality benchmarks.
    - Worked on an Agentic AI workflow that helps analyze existing business processes and improve them
    - Attended hands-on workshop on React.js and software design principles to improve overall development quality and product experience.
