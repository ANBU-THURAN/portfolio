## Role Overview

As a Software Engineer Intern, I worked in a fast-paced agile development environment, collaborating closely with cross-functional teams.
My primary focus was on bug fixes, feature development, and enhancements in user management, with an emphasis on stability, security, and scalability.

### Contributions

- Implemented environment-level limits for critical entities such as users and documents, ensuring system stability and controlled resource usage across deployments.

- Designed and integrated audit event logging for sensitive user-management operations, including SCIM bearer token generation and deletion, improving traceability and security compliance.

- Contributed to a core configuration mechanism responsible for automatically updating the production environment, supporting smoother and more reliable deployments.

- Strengthened system reliability and security by addressing security vulnerabilities, fixing test automation issues, and upgrading project dependencies to newer, stable versions.
